# SAFE
Security Asset Framework for Elicitation
C++ based application with the goal to provide an interface with which the user can elicit security related materials in order to identify the flaws in a given system.

As of yet, the project only reflects the most generally accepted security items in an asset model. Later in the design, the data strututes of the application should reflect a chosen security model after a careful review.
